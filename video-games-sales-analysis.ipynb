In this data analysis endeavor, we will delve into a comprehensive dataset containing information about video games with sales exceeding 100,000 copies. This dataset was meticulously scraped from vgchartz.com, a renowned source for video game sales data.\n\n## Project Overview\n\nVideo games have become a global cultural phenomenon, with millions of copies sold each year across various gaming platforms. This project aims to uncover valuable insights and trends within the video game industry by examining the dataset's extensive information, which includes:\n\n- **Rank:** The ranking of video games based on overall sales.\n- **Name:** The title of the game.\n- **Platform:** The platform on which the game was released (e.g., PC, PS4, Xbox, etc.).\n- **Year:** The year of the game's release.\n- **Genre:** The genre or category of the game.\n- **Publisher:** The company responsible for publishing the game.\n- **Sales Data:** Sales figures for North America, Europe, Japan, and the rest of the world, as well as global sales totals.\n\n## Project Objectives\n\nOur project aimed to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the video game industry through the following key objectives:\n\n1. **Sales Trends Over Time:** Analyze the historical sales trends of video games to identify patterns and fluctuations in global game sales over the years.\n\n2. **Sales By Genre:** Investigate the popularity of different game genres based on sales figures and uncover any emerging trends in genre preferences.\n\n3. **Sales By Platform:** Determine the most successful gaming platforms by examining total sales and track changes in platform popularity over time.\n\n4. **Identify Top Publishers, Genres, and Platforms:** Identify the top-performing publishers, game genres, and gaming platforms based on their sales performance.\n\n5. **Calculate Market Share Over the Years:** Calculate and interpret market share trends for various regions, shedding light on the regions that contribute most significantly to the global market.\n\n6. **Interpretation of Market Share Trends:** Provide insights into the implications of market share trends, highlighting whether certain regions are gaining or losing importance in the industry.\n\n7. **Analyze Genre Popularity:** Explore genre popularity in specific regions and identify variations in genre preferences among different markets.\n\n8. **Analyze Genre Success in Specific Regions:** Investigate how well specific game genres perform in individual regions and pinpoint games that excel in particular markets.\n\n9. **Visualize Genre Trends Over Time:** Create visualizations to illustrate the evolution of genre preferences over time and capture shifts in genre popularity.\n\n10. **Analyze Publisher Performance:** Evaluate the performance of game publishers based on sales data, identifying publishers with consistent success and influence in the industry.\n\n11. **Analyze Consistency in Publisher Performance:** Examine whether publishers maintain consistent performance across various regions and platforms.\n\n12. **Interpretation of Publisher Performance:** Interpret the significance of publisher performance and its impact on the gaming industry.\n\n13. **Regional Sales Analysis:** Investigate regional variations in video game sales, comparing sales figures in North America, Europe, Japan, and other regions. Identify games that perform exceptionally well or poorly in specific regions.\n\nThese objectives guided our analysis and provided a structured approach to gaining insights into the video game industry. By addressing each of these objectives, we aimed to develop a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics, preferences, and trends within the gaming world.\n\n## Data Sources\n\nThe dataset used in this project is available on kaggle and was collected from vgchartz.com using a custom web scraping script  \nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales\n\n## Tools and Technologies\n\nWe will leverage popular data analysis and visualization tools such as Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.\n\n## Let's Get Started!\n\nHappy gaming and data
